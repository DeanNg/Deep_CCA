# DCCA: Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis

An implementation of Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA or Deep CCA) in Python with plain library like numpy and scipy need installed.

DCCA is a method to learn com-plex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated.

DCCA is originally proposed in the paper: Andrew G, Arora R, Bilmes J, et al. Deep canonical correlation analysis[C]//International Conference on Machine Learning. 2013: 1247-1255.

Many followers use this idea for many fields like following paper for matching images and text:
